# README

## Abstract

This repository will serve as a collection place for exercises in Azure.  These will vary from Proofs-of-Concept to working lab-style learning exercises

## Using this repository

Each activity should be as self-contained as possible.  If dependancies are required, great care should be taken to understand the collaborative model of the source itself.  For example, if the MAINTAINER of the content is not defined, or is no longer active, it may be more appropriate to ``fork`` that source, rather than creating a ``pull request``, as existing customers of the content may experience a breaking change if content they require is updated, but no existing MAINTAINER can manage customer impact.  Also consider that just because something doesn't have a good MAINTAINER today, it is likely to have one in the future, since the component is defacto in use
